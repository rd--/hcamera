hcamera
-------

Trivial EXIF image file tool.

Given a directory structure:

----   ----------------------------
css    `hcamera.css`
jpeg   source image files
jpeg/n image reductions (generated)
html   indices (generated)
----   ----------------------------

- `hcamera rename jpeg` will rename all EXIF files at `jpeg` that are
   not already named `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`, ie. `2012-08-10-19-58-28`.

- `hcamera resize jpeg` will make reductions of all images at `jpeg`
   that do not already have reductions at `jpeg/n`.

- `hcamera gen-html jpeg` will generate an index at `html/index.html`
   with sub-indices for each calendar month having images at `jpeg`.
